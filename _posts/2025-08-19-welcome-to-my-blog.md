Welcome to my new blog! This is where I'll be sharing my thoughts on technology, design, and life.

## What You Can Expect

I'll be writing about:
- Web development and design
- Technology trends
- Personal projects
- Random thoughts and ideas

## The Design

This blog is inspired by Apple's clean, minimalist design philosophy. I believe in letting content shine through beautiful, functional design.

The site features:
- **Clean Typography**: Using Apple's system fonts for optimal readability
- **Smooth Animations**: Subtle hover effects and transitions
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on all devices
- **Fast Loading**: Optimized for performance

## Writing in Markdown

One of the great things about Jekyll is that I can write posts in simple Markdown. Here are some examples:

### Code Blocks

```javascript
function hello() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}
